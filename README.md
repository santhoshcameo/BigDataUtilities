Volume Definer Utility :


As most of them know , working with  Big Data is  Really  interesting one , but few of the occassions it's tedious task to find the volume/Size of the directories and its sub directoties . 
The volume definer utility is the Hadoop/BigData  Job which will run and produce the directory wise  size ( while running the mapper ) and produce the total size of the directory while reducer runs.

Working :


1 . Give first argument as input folder location in a text file
2.  Second argument as output folder 

Result :
The Output text file prints directory wise volume line by line.

Here you Go....!!!
